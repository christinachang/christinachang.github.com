    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Up until recently, my experience with technology has primarily been as a consumer and end user. Whenever I interact with a beautifully designed website or a user friendly application, it would fill me with awe and wonder. &#8220;How was this made? How does it do what it does? It must be magic!&#8221;</p>

<p>I also often think, &#8220;It would be great if there was an app that could do x, y or z,&#8221; or &#8220;This tool would be so much easier to use if&#8230; blah blah blah.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those thoughts and ideas eventually evolved into the desire to take the initiative to learn to build products myself. And that has led me to The Flatiron School where I am today, learning to code and demystifying the magical powers of the Internet and technology. My goal for the next three months is to learn as much as I can and go on to help create something that will make a positive difference in the world.</p>
