<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/29/drupal-org-hacked-user-details-exposed-and-reset/">TechCrunch</a> reports yesterday that Drupal.org's server was hacked, exposing profile information such as username, email address, hashed password, and country. This incident highlights the importance of password security, a topic that I recently blogged about <a href="http://christinachang.github.io/blog/2013/05/28/pass-the-salt-securing-passwords-with-salting-and-hashing/">here</a>.

As web consumers, it's important that we do our part to make our passwords more secure. Some general rules to follow:<br>
- Don't use simple words or phrases as your password;<br>
- Don't use the same password on multiple sites or services;<br>
- Use different types of characters - upper/lower case characters, numbers, and symbols.<br>

You might also want to consider using a password manager to generate and manage strong and unique passwords. Some password manager services include <a href="http://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>, <a href="http://keepass.info">KeePass</a>, <a href="http://lastpass.com">LastPass</a>, and <a href="http://www.roboform.com">RoboForm</a>.

If there's a password manager that you use and like, post it in the comments!
